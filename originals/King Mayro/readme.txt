hey so uh message boxes crash the game, everything else seems to work though. I don't know if you
can abuse the game though.

You have to press A on the spring by the way, not the bricks.



Also for funnsies you can press down, up, right, left after the title screen fades in for rom info. 
That's neat I guess


Enjoy! :]
