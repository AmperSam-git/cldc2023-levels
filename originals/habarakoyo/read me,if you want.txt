The Remake of my old and the first complete level for CLDC2023

wanted to make something new with exgraphics but just total dum-dum with it, so yea.

About the actual level itself: it's nothing special about
Just a classic SMW-inspired level, no new mechanics of something like that.
hope you enjoy. :)



P.S: And About the life-farm, i hope i did nothing wrong with it and about 40 lives
is enough to beat this level... yea, that's all.
