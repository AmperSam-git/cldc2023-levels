To install it, you need to ADD a header to a clean SMW ROM. Do not use Lunar Magic before installing the BPS patch. The ROM Hasher should look like this.

Simply add 512 bytes to a clean SMW ROM, THEN install the BPS Patch so I would not get disqualified for submitting a broken patch. Don't be like Jeosberry!

Per rules for Idol for the CLDC entry, MAKE SURE you submit your levels and create the BPS patch properly.
